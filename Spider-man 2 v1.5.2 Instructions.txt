Please follow all the below steps to install it properly.

1. Download the file's from torrent or your preferred way. I have downloaded the file's in my pc and you can skip the additional languages pack and optional bonus content if you don't want it.

4. After installation completes, extract the rar file of update 1.5.2.

5. Open Update 1.5.2 folder and copy all the files from the folder and paste it inside of the game installed folder.

6. Go to game installed folder and right click on "SM2Launcher" and run it as administrator.

7. Click on settings and make sure it does not show "Game is currently installed on slow storage (HDD/USB)". If it shows this error then uninstall the game from the installed drive and install the game in other fastest drive.

8. Once you choose all the required settings based on your pc specification, Click on "OK".

9. Connect any Controller\Joystick\Gamepad using Bluetooth or usb wired to pc.
